        For the final projet I'm thinking about making a website that accesses an api like omdbapi.com to retrieve information
        about movies and tv shows, and allows users to compare shows, view information about a show graphically based on checked
        criteria, show trend-lines, give recommendations, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For layout, it would have a homepage with minor information about the site, and a grid layout for the services with an image for each service. And then every level down from
        the home page will have a top menu for navigation, possibly with similar services being in a dropdown. Collapsable side-nav can be used to enter required info for each service.
        For design it would have a very simple white base design,
        colours could come from graphical elements and movie/show posters.
      </p>

        As I don't think the final project criteria is avialable yet I'm not sure if this would meet all the requirements. I also don't know if this would be too out of scope 
        or if it would demonstrate what we've learned in the course enough. I do have some experience with js, chartjs and the omdbapi api, though, as I used them in my spare time.
