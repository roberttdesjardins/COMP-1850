<h2>Assignment 1 &ndash; Create a 3-Page Website</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Create a small website with three (3) linked pages using the HTML5 standard. Base your website on a theme of interest to you. Pick a topic based on:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>A hobby or special interest (e.g. fishing, a sport you take part in, your family pets, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An area of study or expertise (e.g. financial investing for beginners, learning Chinese, etc.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Your HTML5 pages should conform to <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=485378&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=BCIT-2492687" target="_self">COMP 1850 House Rules</a>&nbsp;in addition to meeting these specific criteria:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Tables are used to organize layout of <em>at least part</em> of each page (RECOMMENDED: use tables for layout of whole page)</li>
<li>A navigation menu consistent across all three pages</li>
<li>CSS for at least three selectors, defined using a &lt;style&gt; tag (i.e. EMBEDDED CSS)</li>
<li>At least three different BLOCK tags and three different INLINE tags&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><em>Note: you will identify these as the QUESTION part of this submission, demonstrating you can identify each as BLOCK or INLINE elements.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A consistent footer including a link to your email address</li>
<li>Links to outside resources on at least one page.</li>
<li>An image on each page. (note: be sure to <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=485378&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=BCIT-2495778" target="_self">right-size</a> the image and conform to other requirements of House Rules for images.)</li>
<li>Coloured backgrounds and/or text with good contrast and readability</li>
<li>Underlying file structure based on a one of the following structures:
<ul>
<li>EITHER homepage in site root and one folder for 2nd and 3rd pages containing all files relating to the 2nd and 3rd pages, respectively</li>
<li>OR all html files in site root and all images in a sub-folder named images (RECOMMENDED: This choice is the most common.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h4>TROUBLE MAKERS TO WATCH OUT FOR</h4>
<p>The following are things students have had trouble with in the past.</p>
<p><em>EMBEDDED CSS</em></p>
<p>Remember you are expected to use embedded CSS. This is where you use the &lt;style&gt; tag inside the &lt;head&gt; tag.</p>
<p><em>RIGHT-SIZED IMAGES</em></p>
<p>Re-size your images manually with an image editor. If you don&rsquo;t have an image editor handy you can do this online (e.g. <a href="http://imageresize.org/">http://imageresize.org/</a> or google &ldquo;re-size image online&rdquo; and try out some others). If you display a large image in a small space, it is an error.</p>
<p><em>CASE SENSITIVITY PROBLEMS OR MISSING FILES</em></p>
<p>Check your work online after uploading. The server is Unix-based and case sensitive while Windows OS is not. Also, people sometimes forget to upload images or put them in the wrong folders. Code and actual location of file must match.</p>
