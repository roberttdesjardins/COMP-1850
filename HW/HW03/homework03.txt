Write-up:
Element: An example of an element selector would be for h2. The CSS code in h2 affects all h2 tags where the css file is linked. 

Class or ID: An example of an ID selector is the #wrapper selector in the css file. It affects only the tag with the id set to wrapper

descendant: An example of a descendant element would be "nav a" in the the css file. This only affects <a> tags within a <nav> tag. 


Using an html validator service, it gives errors for not including an alt attribute for the images used, but I'm assuming that isn't an issue.
