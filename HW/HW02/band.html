        Overview:
      </h2>
      <p>
        DIO was a heavy metal band formed in 1982 when Ronnie James Dio and Vinny Appice left Black Sabbath 
        due to an argument. The band released 10 studio albums throughout its history, its first and most famous album being Holy Diver.
        Ronnie died in 2010 due to cancer which resulted in the end of the band.

        My personal favorite albums:
      </h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Holy Diver (1983)</dt>
        <dd>
          The bands debut and most famous album, Holy Diver set a high benchmark for metal and rock bands and 
          proved that Ronnie could stand on his own outside of Black Sabbath. It's title song, Holy Diver, and Don't Talk to Strangers 
          are the two standouts from the album in my opinion. 
        </dd>
        <dt>Dream Evil (1987)</dt>
        <dd>
          Dream Evil is the bands 4<sup>th</sup> album and marks a slight departure from the previous 3 albums by incorperating more melodic elements yet still retains the passion 
          and metal elements which the band had become known for. Some of the standout songs form the album include Sunset Superman and Naked in the Rain. 
        </dd>
        <dt>Magica (2000)</dt>
        <dd>
          Magica is the bands 8<sup>th</sup> album and is often regarded as a comeback album after a few less well recieved albums. Simon Wright and Jimmy Bain returned to DIO for 
          this album. Magica tells a story of good vs. evil, which is a departure from previous albums which are more about standalone songs.
