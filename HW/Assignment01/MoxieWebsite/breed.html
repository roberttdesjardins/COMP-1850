              Toy poodles are a purposely breed small variant of the standard poodle and thus share many characteristics with the standard poodle. These include an extremely high intelligence, desire to please, and gentle nature. In addition they share a need for exercise and socialization similar to their larger brethren.

            <td headers="breed_type" class="toy_poodle_info">
              Toy poodles, however, differ slightly in their personalities and temperaments. Toy poodles have a particularly strong affinity for people and love meeting new people, yet still are loyal to their owners and can act as watch dogs, if only in warning barks and not physical presence.

          <tr>
            <td headers="breed_type" class="toy_poodle_info">
              Toy poodles require daily walks, but otherwise are very calm and will lay next to you or on your lap all evening, which is ideal for apartment living as they do not need much space indoors to run around.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td headers="breed_type" class="toy_poodle_info">
              As with most smaller breeds, toy poodles have a very long life span of around 15 years. They weigh around 6-9 pounds. Also, toy poodles are considered "Hypo-allergenic" as they shed far less than most other dog breeds.

          <tr>
            <td headers="breed_type" class="toy_poodle_info">
              All in all, toy poodles make great companions for those in smaller living quarters, people with allergies, people who don't want to constantly clean up hair, or just for people who love a loyal and intelligent dog with a great personality.
