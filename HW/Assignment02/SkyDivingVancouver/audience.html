        I believe the users of this site would be younger adults in their 20's and 30's. This is due to the nature of skydiving 
        which generally appeals to younger thrill seekers, though it is possible that some older adults would be interested. 
        As the skydiving services provided are age restricted to 18+, there is little need to appeal to those much younger than 18. 
        However, those close to 18 could still visit the site if they are interested in it in the future.

        As per the target audience of thrill seekers, my website tries to add some brighter colours to appear more "fun".
        I didn't want to go overboard and look too childish, which is why I tried to stick to a base of sky blue with a little bit of orange
        as a complementary colour. I also went with sky blue due to the obvious association with the sky and skydiving. In addition to the colour palette, 
        images were chosen which fit the theme and colours and the introduction page features a "hero" image to draw users in.

        I tried to keep the layout easy to view and navigate, without walls of text and information. The website has basic 
        info about bundle choices and their prices. By only being a one level deep website, there was no need for breadcrumb navigation 
        or other ways to find your location. The menu at the top of every page makes it easy to navigate, and the fact that it is fluid means that
        users on any device size or browser size can navigate the page without horizontal scrolling (though I would have prefered using media queries 
        and a collapsable menu to deal with this in a more visually appealing way).

        Finally, Arial from the sans serif font family was chosen because it is clear and legible on a digital display and the contact page features 4 different
        contact choices (Phone, Text, Email, and Facebook) so that anyone can contact the company.
