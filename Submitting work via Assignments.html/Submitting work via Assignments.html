<p>In the next submodule you'll find the criteria for your first submission HW1 and get access to the ASSIGNMENTS dropbox for HW1.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's important you understand the submission process before you go ahead and do the work.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You should also understand how you will be graded.</li>
</ul>
<h2>GRADING IN COMP 1850</h2>
<ul>
<li>For a breakdown of grades see <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=485378&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=BCIT-2473303" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graded course components</a>.</li>
<li>For details on the "best 5 out of 6" grading for homework see <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=485378&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=BCIT-2477497" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homework grades</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SUBMISSION PROCESS VIA ASSIGNMENTS TOOL</h2>
<ul>
<li>Homework (6), assignments (2) and the project (1) are all submitted in the same way using the ASSIGNMENTS tool</li>
<li>Since it is a little counter intuitive how this is done (i.e. do NOT submit all your files as a zip package), it is important you master the process.</li>
<li>At minimum, work submitted the wrong way will cost you marks. If too difficult to work with, you could receive a zero.</li>
</ul>
<h2>HOW TO SUBMIT VIA ASSIGNMENTS TOOL</h2>
<ol>
<li>Complete your work on your PC.
<ul>
<li>For HW1 this means creating a single HTML file. But the process is the same even if you create a whole web site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upload your work to your student account on bcitwebdev.com using your FTP Client (e.g. FileZilla)
<ul>
<li>TEST your site on bcitwebdev.com by visiting every page that is part of the site. (Note: there's just one page for HW1)</li>
<li>FIX any broken links caused by
<ul>
<li>case sensitivity problems <em>(e.g. you named the file Foo.html but your code says foo.html -- which becomes a problem on a unix platform like bcitwebdev.com because unlike on Windows which is case insensitive, Foo.html and foo.html are two different files on a case sensitive platform.)</em></li>
<li>incomplete upload of your files <em>(e.g. you forgot to upload an image file needed by your site)</em></li>
<li>incorrect placement of your files <em>(e.g. you had subfolders on your local site but uploaded all the files into one folder on bcitwebdev.com)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Copy the URL for the homepage of your site from the address bar of the web browser
<ul>
<li>for the demostudent, the URL for HW1 is&nbsp;<a href="http://students.bcitwebdev.com/ljwstudent/homework01.html">http://students.bcitwebdev.com/ljwstudent/homework01.html</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Do not copy&nbsp;<a href="http://students.bcitwebdev.com/ljwstudent/homework01.html">http://students.bcitwebdev.com/ljwstudent/</a>&nbsp;instead, as this is the root for the student account and doesn't identify what the student means to be his/her first homework assignment. Potentially, there could be a lot of unrelated files in the root due to experiments in using ftp, for example.</li>
<li>Do not copy the URL for the folder you put future work in such as <a href="http://students.bcitwebdev.com/ljwstudent/homework01.html">http://students.bcitwebdev.com/ljwstudent/assign1</a>&nbsp;for the first assignment. Students are to <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=485378&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=BCIT-2478089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AVOID the normal practice</a>&nbsp;of calling the homepage for a site (i.e. a group of linked web pages) index.html or home.html because this hinders the process of marking. Instead, you might name your homepage for assignment one something like this:&nbsp;<a href="http://students.bcitwebdev.com/ljwstudent/homework01.html">http://students.bcitwebdev.com/ljwstudent/assign1/assign1.html</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a text file with extension .txt that is named for the work you plan to submit, and paste the URL for your work into it.
<ul>
<li>The demo student would create a file called homework1.txt, for example, and put the URL for his/her HW1 (i.e.&nbsp;<a href="http://students.bcitwebdev.com/ljwstudent/homework01.html">http://students.bcitwebdev.com/ljwstudent/homework01.html</a>&nbsp;) in this text file.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Read the instructions for each ASSIGNMENT Tool submission carefully. In some cases you will be asked to answer questions in this text file as well and pasting in the URL where the work is to be found.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Submit via the ASSIGNMENTS dropbox for the required work
<ul>
<li>upload the text file (e.g. homework1.txt) as the file you are submitting. You MUST submit a file, so this is the workaround established by the instructor. Otherwise you could just copy and paste the URL and any notes required into the comment field.</li>
<li><span style="color: #2b78e4;">OPTIONAL</span>: copy and paste the URL into the comments field, as well.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Last but not least, take advantage of the RUBRIC attached to each ASSIGNMENT (i.e. homework, assignments, project) to be sure you know EXACTLY what you are being graded on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's an example of a submission file (text file with .txt extension) open in a text editor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This text editor is Brackets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The text file contains the URL for the work uploaded to the bcitwedev.com server for the demo student ljwstudent</p>

<p>In this illustration, the student has saved and uploaded his/her submission file.</p>
<p>The dropbox requires a file be uploaded. Therefore it is not enough to simply put the URL in the "Comments" field. So the instructor has worked out this process to make the dropbox work for us in COMP 1850.</p>
<p>The dropbox shows (1) to submit and lists it below.</p>
<ul>
<li>To delete the file and upload a different one just hit the X beside homework1.txt in blue</li>
<li>Then upload the corrected file&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are sure you have things right, hit the SUBMIT button</p>

<p><em><strong>CURIOUS FACT:</strong>&nbsp; What if you change your homework01.html file on the bcitwebdev server AFTER you submit your work? Which copy of the homework01.html file is marked?</em></p>
<p><em>Well ... since all you submitted was the ADDRESS for where to find your homepage, then if whatever is at that address CHANGES ... the new version is what gets marked. However, once submitted the instructor may mark your work at any time, and will mark what is found at the time concerned. So the "extension" is a Russian Roulette one in which the grace period can expire at any moment. And you MUST have submitted the URL on time.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>In short, students are welcome to "fix up" their work after submission so long as they understand how this works and they get the submission done on time.</em></p>
<p><em>WARNING: REMEMBER THE IMPORTANCE OF FILE AND FOLDER NAMES. Never change the name of the file or the folders in its path after you've submitted a homepage. You can change anything else so long as it all still works, but the instructor will mark what is found via the submitted URL.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, never ask to have the URL changed because you uploaded something new. You are expected to understand <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=485378&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=BCIT-2477896" target="_blank" rel="noopener">file management</a>&nbsp;well enough to keep the URL consistent after submission, even if you chose to tinker with your site after submission.</em></p>
