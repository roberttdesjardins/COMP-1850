<h2>Overview</h2>
<ol>
<li>AUDIENCE. Be able to explain your design decisions in terms of the intended audience.
<ul>
<li>one of your meta pages (explained below) is dedicated to this write up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FLUID. Your site should demonstrate fluid (a.k.a. liquid) design as described in chapter 5 of the textbook.
<ul>
<li>your site should re-flow in a presentable manner for viewport widths from full to half-screen of a typical laptop or desktop.</li>
<li>DO NOT attempt "responsive design" using media queries. This is beyond the scope of the assignment. See <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=485378&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=BCIT-2488656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meeting the Criteria</a>&nbsp;in the Course Dictionary.</li>
<li>If you are puzzled about the difference between a merely fluid design (re-flows when the viewport changes and might use responsive images) and a fully responsive design (switches CSS code based on size of viewport using media queries) - be sure to experiment with some of the past examples shared on the NEWS to get the idea before investing a lot of time in work beyond the scope of COMP1850 curriculum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AUDIENCE-FACING pages. These are the pages that constitute your site from the point of view of your audience.
<ul>
<li>The three (3) site pages are described below.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>META PAGES. In addition to three pages that represent your site as it would be viewed by your audience, include three pages intended to inform the instructor of design decisions and facilitate marking.
<ul>
<li>Include these meta pages in your main menu, even though they are not part of the "real" site, or what a site such as this would be like if shared with the world.</li>
<li>The three (3) meta pages required are described below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Audience-facing Pages</h2>
<ol>
<li>An&nbsp;<strong>introduction page</strong>&nbsp;(your home page) introducing your imaginary business or service.
<ul>
<li>Name the page something like assign2.html instead of index.html, etc. to make it possible to see a listing of your files in assign2 folder.</li>
<li>Feature an image. Make this a responsive image if necessary for good results when resizing the viewport within the stipulated range (i.e. full to half screen of normal PC).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<strong>catalog page</strong>&nbsp;listing repetitive items, within internal navigation.
<ul>
<li>examples might be: an inventory, a list of songs, a list of real estate properties, past successes, news articles, etc.</li>
<li>The nature of the list will depend on the organization you pick.</li>
<li>The list should be long enough to require scrolling to reach the bottom.</li>
<li>Provide for internal page navigation to jump into at least 2 sub-sections and back again to the top.</li>
<li>Use fragment identifiers to create this secondary menu internal to the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<strong>contact us</strong>&nbsp;page.
<ul>
<li>Provide entries for 2-4 staff members.</li>
<li>Each entry should have:
<ul>
<li>a featured image</li>
<li>the name of the contact</li>
<li>the role and/or title of the contact</li>
<li>two kinds of contact information (e.g. phone number and email)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you provide an e-mail address, make it a link.</li>
<li>You do not need to make links to other invented contact information, such as social media connections or phone numbers.</li>
<li>Make reasonable choices about contact options given your target audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Meta Pages</h2>
<ol>
<li>An&nbsp;<strong>audience</strong>&nbsp;page where you describe your assumptions about the users of the site.
<ul>
<li>Make a case, in at least two paragraphs, for why the nature of the audience justifies your choices about layout, menus, colours, fonts, etc.</li>
<li>Mention any audience-related decisions about other details. (e.g. contact options)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A page called&nbsp;<strong>criteria</strong>&nbsp;that uses a table to explain how and where requirements are met.
<ul>
<li>An example table is provided at the end of this description of Assignment 2, for you to adapt. It uses placeholders for actual examples.</li>
<li>Where meaningful, use special entity characters to make your code examples visible when rendered by the browser.</li>
<li>If puzzled about what's wanted, because of the placeholder content below, be sure to check examples from past courses to get the idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A page called&nbsp;<strong>project</strong>&nbsp;describing your plans for the final project.
<ul>
<li>You should have a topic in mind by now. If not, explain what decision you still need to make and what steps you'll take to do so.</li>
<li>If you have ideas about layout or audience details, share these, too.</li>
<li>If you have questions or concerns about the project you can ask them via email to the instructor.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You should have at least two paragraphs and 200 to 500 words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to descriptions of pages, above, your assignment 2 site should meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>a unified look for your website for all six (6) pages. (Defend your choices on the&nbsp;<strong>audience</strong>&nbsp;meta page.)</li>
<li>meets the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=485378&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=BCIT-2492687" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COMP 1850 House Rules</a></li>
<li>CSS requirements
<ul>
<li>uses one (1) external style sheet for all shared CSS that is included in every file</li>
<li>one (1) example of a page that also uses embedded CSS to override the external style sheet</li>
<li>one (1) example of overriding both the external style sheet (and/or the embedded CSS) using inline CSS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use of a semantic elements in a manner that is semantically appropriate, with formatting supplied by CSS.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use of DIV or SPAN with an aptly named ID. (One example minimum.)</li>
<li>Use of DIV or SPAN with a CLASS attribute you create, with a semantically meaningful name. (One example minimum.)</li>
<li>Demonstrate mastery of the box model (p. 222 in text).</li>
<li><strong>NO</strong>&nbsp;use of deprecated tags or attributes (HTML5). See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML Reference</a>&nbsp;to identify deprecated tags and attributes.</li>
<li>Use of at least two (2) tags&nbsp;<strong>new</strong>&nbsp;to (HTML5).
<ul>
<li>See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML Reference</a>&nbsp;to identify new tags.</li>

<p>example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The catalog page has a secondary menu, across the top, that is broken down by categories of farming equipment. The user can jump into a category and back again to the top. Colours make it clear this menu belongs to the site without confusing it with the main menu.</p>
