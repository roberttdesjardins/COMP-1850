    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id="about-p">
      <b>Hello!</b> My name is <em>Robert Desjardins</em>. This course interests me because I want to learn more about web development. 
      I have some self taught experience making personal websites but I would like to learn more about best practices,
      proper formatting, and usage of aspects of web dev such as CSS and libraries/frameworks like react and bootstrap. 
    </p><br>
    <h2>First Week Learning</h2>
    <p style="color: blue">
      In the first week I got some experience using FTP, as I haven't used it in many years, and learned about
      some of the history behind the creation of the internet and world wide web. I also learned about what each compenent of 
      a url is called.
