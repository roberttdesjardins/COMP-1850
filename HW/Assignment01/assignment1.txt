My homepage for assignment1 is:

http://students.bcitwebdev.com/83jard/Assignments/Assignment1/assign1.html

Three BLOCK tags which I used:
<div>
<nav>
<li> (Used in about.html within a <ul> - which is also a block tag)

Three INLINE tags used: 
<b> (Used around the "Moxie" text in the first row in about.html. I think this is ok as per http://w3c.github.io/html-reference/b.html as I did not want to convey any extra importance on the word)
<img>
<a>
